# Project Outline
**Running multiple classifications and deep learning models on red and white wine datasets to predict quality.**

*“Accept what life offers you and try to drink from every cup. All wines should be tasted; some should only be sipped, but with others, use them for data studying with machine learning.” -Paulo Coelho with add inspiration from us*

## Datasets
Red and White Wine Datasets from a study down by the University of California, Irvine which were found on Kaggle.
